I did my best\n\nDifferent chord classification methods have accumulated since at least the 17th century, and they mainly serve to describe the most usual cases in a particular idiom. To my knowledge, there is no unified method for classifying chord types into a taxonomy that is also used by practicing musicians.\n\nThis makes classifying chords a complicated topic. Edge cases are everywhere, because some categories that are normally isolated from each other, with only occasional combination, can potentially interact in unspecified ways.\n\nFor instance, non-tertian \"added-tone\" chords and \"altered extensions\" on 7th chords belong to somewhat separate models of chord categorization, but 6th chords can have 9ths. Does this mean added-tone chords like m6 can have any extensions, as in a m6(♯11)? I have personally never seen any such chord, but I have also never seen a rule that says why it cannot be done!\n\nThis `Classification` type is my best attempt to codify the chord type taxonomy, as I understand it, into a type you can destructure for your own purposes (i.e. custom views of chord symbols). Just be aware that, for the reasons I've described, it can represent some combinations that are unusual but not clearly invalid. Use your judgment as to which of these you want to handle, and which you want to ignore.\n\n@docs Classification, Triad, SixthOrSeventh, UnalteredExtension, AlteredExtension\n\n","unions":[{"name":"AlteredExtension","comment":" ","args":[],"cases":[["MinorNinth",[]],["AugmentedNinth",[]],["AugmentedEleventh",[]],["MinorThirteenth",[]]]},{"name":"Classification","comment":" Get an instance of this type by using `ChordType.classify`.\n","args":[],"cases":[["Classification",["Music.Chord.Classification.Triad","Maybe.Maybe Music.Chord.Classification.SixthOrSeventh","Maybe.Maybe Music.Chord.Classification.UnalteredExtension","List.List Music.Chord.Classification.AlteredExtension"]],["Unclassifiable",["List.List Music.Interval.Interval"]]]},{"name":"SixthOrSeventh","comment":" ","args":[],"cases":[["Sixth",[]],["MajorSeventh",[]],["MinorSeventh",[]],["DiminishedSeventh",[]]]},{"name":"Triad","comment":" ","args":[],"cases":[["MajorTriad",[]],["AugmentedTriad",[]],["MinorTriad",[]],["DiminishedTriad",[]],["Sus2Triad",[]],["Sus4Triad",[]]]},{"name":"UnalteredExtension","comment":" ","args":[],"cases":[["Ninth",[]],["Eleventh",[]],["Thirteenth",[]]]}],"aliases":[],"values":[],"binops":[]},{"name":"Music.ChordType","comment":" A [chord type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_%28music%29#Common_types_of_chords) describes the intervals contained in a chord, with no specific root pitch class.

Or maybe you want to write them out in plain English like \"dominant seventh, sharp nine flat thirteen\". You may even want to convert to a more complex view than a `String` can express, like SVG or elm-ui.\n\nIf that's the case, you can use the `Classification` type to write your own custom chord symbol function. A good place to start would be to take a look at the source for `symbol` to see how I did it.\n\nYou may disagree with my interpretation of chord classification too!
